# C-PROJECT-MANAGER
### CPROJECT-MANAGER is a custom build system made by me, it works however not ripe yet enough to use on production
## How to use & build example
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sum1Code/C-Project-Manager
clang build.c -o builder
./builder`
```
  

#### example included in repository and build.c

### DEPRECATED

### TODO:
- [X] ~Implement #define CPM_AS_STRLIB to isolate StringBuilder & StringSlice~ **DEPRECATED** (use cpm_strings module instead)
- [ ] Re-Implement CPMLOG to function like printf
- [ ] Implement the necessary CPM_CLI to be able to be used as a module_manager
