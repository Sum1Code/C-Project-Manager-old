# C-PROJECT-MANAGER
### CPROJECT-MANAGER is a custom build system made by me, it works however not ripe yet enough to use on production
## How to use & build example
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sum1Code/C-Project-Manager
clang build.c -o builder
./builder`
```
  

#### example included in repository and build.c

## NOTICE:
The current CPM.h will be replaced by a newer rewritten and hopefully cleaner system, which required a new seperate repository, this repository will be eventually archived after the new CPM.h is written.
